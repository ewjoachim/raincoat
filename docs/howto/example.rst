Raincoat comments
=================

Raincoat will detect comments in your code, that look like this :

.. code-block:: python

    # Raincoat: pypi package: PACKAGE_NAME==VERSION path: PATH [element: OBJECT_NAME]

Where :

- ``PACKAGE_NAME`` is the name you would use with pip - ``VERSION`` is required (note :
  it can be tempting to imagine that other oprators are available besides ``==``, it's
  not the case)
- ``PATH`` is the path between the place where pip would install a package
  (usually ``site-packages``) and the file containing the definition you want to check.
  It starts with the top module name (which in some cases is different from the package
  name, I know, it's frustrating.)
- ``OBJECT_NAME`` is the name of either a function, a class or a method. For methods,
  the expected format is ``ClassName.method_name``
- If element is not specified, the whole module will be analyzed.
